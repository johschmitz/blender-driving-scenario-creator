# Blender Driving Scenario Creator add-on

This [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on lets you create OpenDRIVE and
OpenSCENARIO based scenarios for development and testing of advanced driver
assistance systems and autonomous driving functions.

## How to install

Prior to installing the add-on inside of Blender some requirements must be
installed. The process slightly differs for Linux and Windows.

###  Requirements Linux

For the sake of simplifying the following instructions let's assume that we
work with a Debian based Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu or Mint) and Blender
has been [downloaded](https://www.blender.org/download/) and installed to

    /opt/blender/

Then we first need to install the
[scenarigeneration](https://github.com/pyoscx/scenariogeneration) library into
the Blender Python environment since the add-on uses the library as a backend to
write OpenDRIVE and OpenSCENARIO files. Additionally,
[pyclothoids](https://github.com/phillipd94/pyclothoids) is needed which is used
by the addon and the scenarigeneration lib as well. Navigate to your Blender
included Python installation

    cd /opt/blender/<blender_version>/python/bin

if pip is not already present in there then run (use sudo only if root is the
owner)

    sudo ./python<python_version> -m ensurepip

now install the lib(s)

    sudo -E ./pip3 install scenariogeneration

where the `-E` makes sudo preserve the exported environment variable. Note again
that `sudo` is not required in case Blender is installed to the user home
directory. Also make sure not to mix up `pip3` and `./pip3`.

For the esmini export functionality we also need to install
[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) to have the `osgconv` tool
available. This is necessary because Blender is unable to directly export to the
.osgb scenegraph format, while esmini can only process this particular format.
On a Debian/Ubuntu/Mint system this can be achieved with

    sudo apt install openscenegraph

If you manually install OpenSceneGraph make sure that `osgconv` can be found
through your `PATH` environment variable, otherwise the export with .osgb 3D
model files will fail.

Install [esmini](ttps://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases). Preferably to
`/opt/esmini` and then put `/opt/esmini/bin` it in your `PATH` environment
variable with an `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/esmini/bin` at the end of the
`~/.bashrc`.

### Requirements Windows

Assuming Blender has been [downloaded](https://www.blender.org/download/) and
installed using the .msi installer, open PowerShell in admin mode by pressing
<kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> and then then <kbd>A</kbd>.

In PowerShell navigate to the Blender install folder with (don't forget to
insert the version number)

    cd "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender <blender_version>\<blender_version>\python\bin"

Run the following command to install the scenariogeneration library

    .\python -m pip install scenariogeneration --target ..\lib\site-packages

Note that you might be able to do this without admin rights in case you are
using the "Portable" version of Blender. Also if you are having trouble with
this part of the installation, consider starting over with a clean installation
of Blender and/or removing any leftovers of Python in your `%appdata%` folder.

Download and extract (for example to `C:\Tools\OpenSceneGraph`)
[openscenegraph](https://objexx.com/OpenSceneGraph.html).

Also download and extract (for exampe to `C:\Tools\esmini`)
[esmini](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases).

Add the OpenSceneGraph `bin` folder and the esmini `bin` folder to the `PATH`
environment variable using the "Edit environment variables for your account"
tool (look for it in the Windows start menu). Note that otherwise the export
with .osgb 3D model files will fail because `osgconv` can not be found by the
add-on.

### Add-on (Linux and Windows)

Finally download the driving scenario generator [release .zip
archive](https://github.com/johschmitz/blender-driving-scenario-creator/releases/).
Open Blender and go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons. Click "Install...".
Select the .zip archive and confirm. Activate the add-on by ticking the little
box next to it, in the add-on list.

## How to use

When you are in the Blender "Layout" workspace, press <kbd>N</kbd> or click the
little arrow next to the navigation gizmo to toggle the sidebar. Click
<kbd>Driving Scenario Creator</kbd> in the sidebar. From here you can create
roads and vehicles using the mouse by clicking the buttons in the "Driving
Scenario Creator" menu. Roads, vehicles and trajectories can be placed with the
mouse. Grid snapping can be activated by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. Additional
geometry sections can be added by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking. Start
heading of a road can be adjusted by holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and moving the mouse
pointer. For some geometries the end heading can be adjusted by holding
<kbd>Shift</kbd> and moving the mouse wheel. Road elevation can be controlled by
holding <kbd>E</kbd>(3D view) or <kbd>S</kbd>(sideview) keys and moving the
mouse. See a summary of the keyboard shortcuts in the table below.

| Keyboard Shortcut                                     | Function                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| <kbd>N</kbd> (vanilla Blender)                        | Toggle sidebar with addon main menu |
| Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>                                  | Activate grid snapping              |
| Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Mouseleft</kbd>          | Add additional geometry section     |
| Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd>                                   | Change start heading of a road      |
| Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Mousewheel Up/Down</kbd> | Change start heading of a road      |
| Hold <kbd>E</kbd>                                     | Control road elevation (3D view)    |
| Hold <kbd>S</kbd>                                     | Control road elevation (sideview)   |

Before or after adding roads add additional Blender objects as desired. When
done modelling, export everything together by clicking <kbd>Export driving
scenario</kbd>. Choose a **directory** and a 3D file format (.fbx, .gltf, .osgb)
for the export and confirm.

## How to run exported scenarios

With esmini available the exported scenario can be run with

    cd <export_directory>
    esmini --osc xosc/bdsc_export.xosc --window 50 50 800 400

# How to develop

For development of the addon the [Blender VS Code
extension](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/blender_vscode) is very
recommendable. It allows hot reloading and rapid iterations.

# How to run the test

There is a handfull of tests for the geometries in the `tests/` directory. They
can be run by executing pytest from the Blender python distribution in the
project root directory

    /opt/blender/<blender_version>/python/bin/pytest

If pytest is not installed use pip to install it into the Blender directory as
described with the scenariogeneration library above.

The tests can also be run and debugged from within VS Code by adding the
following line to the `.vscode/settings.json` which is generated by VS Code when
configuring/scanning for the tests

    {
        ...
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/opt/blender/<blender_version>/python/bin/python3.<python_version>",
        ...
    }
